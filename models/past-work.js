    description: 'The Nest Installer Portal served as the primary point-of-contact between Nest and Nest Certified installers. It facilitated the ability for certified installers to view, accept, and track install requests; order thermostats, apperal, and marketing materials; provided training and certification; tracked installer ratings; and implemented a custom currency (Nest Points). I coded the portal UI from scratch pixel-perfect to mockups and style guidlines provided by Nest. The portal supported both English and French, makes heavy use of Ajax and jQuery, is responsive and supports all modern browsers on desktop and mobile devices.',
